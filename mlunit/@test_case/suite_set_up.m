function suite_set_up(self)
%Suite initialization.
%  suite_set_up is called once before any test of this suite is
%  executed. Perform frontal suite initialization here.
%
%  suite_set_up is not called on any particular test_case object, therefore
%  it cannot set any object states, i.e. member variables. In fact, it is called
%  by instantiating an altogether new test_case object.
